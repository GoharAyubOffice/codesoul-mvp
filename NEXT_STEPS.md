## 📋 Complete Verification Checklist

### Database Level
- [ ] Run: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM repositories;` → Should be > 0
- [ ] Run: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_visualizations;` → Should be > 0
- [ ] Run: `SELECT * FROM repositories LIMIT 1;` → Data looks correct
- [ ] Run: `SELECT * FROM user_visualizations LIMIT 1;` → Data looks correct

### Application Level
- [ ] Visit `/dashboard` → Can visualize repos
- [ ] Visualize `facebook/react` → See score at bottom
- [ ] Visit `/leaderboard` → See facebook/react in rankings
- [ ] Click "My Visualizations" → See your visualization history
- [ ] Click repo link → Goes to GitHub ✓
- [ ] Visualization date/time shows correctly ✓

### Browser Console Level
- [ ] No red error messages
- [ ] See "Recording visualization..." logs
- [ ] See "Visualization recorded successfully..." logs
- [ ] Network tab shows POST 200 to `/api/leaderboard`

## 🎯 If Everything Works

Congratulations! The leaderboard system is fully functional. You can:

1. **Deploy to Production**
   - Everything is ready for Vercel
   - No additional changes needed for MVP

2. **Collect Initial Data**
   - Have users visualize repositories
   - Watch leaderboard populate
   - Track score distributions

3. **Monitor Performance**
   - Check database query times
   - Monitor Supabase usage
   - Track user engagement with leaderboard

4. **Plan Post-MVP**
   - Read `LEADERBOARD_SETUP.md` "Future Enhancements" section
   - Consider adding filters, achievements, etc.

## ⚠️ If Something Doesn't Work

### Check These in Order

1. **Server Logs**
   - Look at terminal where you ran `npm run dev`
   - Copy exact error message

2. **Browser Console**
   - F12 → Console tab
   - Look for red error messages

3. **Network Tab**
   - F12 → Network tab
   - Try to visualize a repo
   - Look for failed requests
   - Check response body for error details

4. **Database Logs**
   - Supabase Dashboard → Logs
   - Look for any errors there

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue: Still getting "Failed to record visualization"**
- Migration might not have run properly
- Run migration again in Supabase SQL Editor
- Make sure you restart dev server after

**Issue: Leaderboard shows no data**
- Check if POST to `/api/leaderboard` is succeeding (Network tab)
- Check if repositories exist in database
- Try visualizing a different repo

**Issue: Personal history shows nothing**
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check if user_visualizations table has data
- Clear browser cache and try again

## 🎓 How the System Works (Quick Summary)

1. **User visualizes a repo** → `/dashboard` → Enter GitHub URL
2. **GitHub API fetches data** → `lib/github/api.ts` gets repo info + ID
3. **Score calculated** → `lib/scoring/calculateScore.ts` scores 0-100
4. **API saves visualization** → `POST /api/leaderboard`
   - Creates repository record (if new)
   - Records user visualization
5. **Leaderboard updates** → `/leaderboard` shows top repos
6. **Personal history visible** → "My Visualizations" tab shows user's repos

```bash
# Make sure everything is committed
git status

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel deploy --prod

# Or use your preferred hosting
```

No database migrations or configuration changes needed on deployment!
